This project is a high-performance backend application built using FastAPI, designed to create scalable and production-ready RESTful APIs with asynchronous support. It follows a clean and modular architecture, ensuring maintainability and efficient request handling through Pydantic-based data validation and structured exception management. The application supports full CRUD operations, integrates seamlessly with relational databases using SQLAlchemy, and implements secure JWT-based authentication and authorization mechanisms. With automatic interactive API documentation via Swagger UI and ReDoc, the system enables easy testing and exploration of endpoints. The project is containerized using Docker for simplified deployment and demonstrates strong backend engineering skills, API design best practices, and performance optimization techniques.
